                Kelantan (Malay pronunciation: [kəˈlantan]; Jawi: کلنتن; Kelantanese Malay: Klate; Pattani Malay pronunciation: [kläˈtɛ])[a] is a state in Malaysia. The capital, Kota Bharu, includes the royal seat of Kubang Kerian. 
                The honorific name of the state is Darul Naim (Jawi: دار النعيم; "The Blissful Abode"). Kelantan is the only state outside of East Malaysia that does not use the term district in its second-level administrative division. Instead, the districts is named as colonies (Jajahan) or collectivities and one autonomous subdistrict.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kelantan is located in the north-eastern corner of the peninsula. Kelantan, which is said to translate as the "Land of Lightning" (see alternate theories below), is an agrarian state with green paddy fields, rustic fishing villages and casuarina-lined beaches. Kelantan is home to some of the most ancient archaeological discoveries in Malaysia, including several prehistoric aboriginal settlements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to Kelantan's relative isolation and largely rural lifestyle, Kelantanese culture differs somewhat from Malay culture in the rest of the peninsula; this is reflected in the cuisine, arts and the unique Kelantanese Malay language, which is unintelligible even for some speakers of standard Malay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kelantan is positioned in the north-east of the Malay Peninsula. It is bordered by Narathiwat Province of Thailand to the north, Terengganu to the south-east, Perak to the west and Pahang to the south. To the north-east of Kelantan is the South China Sea. Kelantan has diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate. The state's mountain ranges belong to the Titiwangsa Mountains, which are part of the Tenasserim Hills 
                that span throughout southern Myanmar, southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, with Mount Yong Belar being the state's highest point.

                In this house begins the book of human life named Amir Yahya. Growing up among four siblings and being the youngest son, I could say my life was filled with a lot of grief. With this home of grandparents' spirits, 
                where my family travels in the shadows and searches for livelihoods.
            </p>
            <p>
                With its strategic location in the urban area of Bharu City plus the educational facilities facing the home, it is a blessing because in that way we as a family can find livelihoods as well as cover the family's financial expenses.

                Kampung Pasir Dusun, Jeli, Kelantan, is the village hometown of my father. Indeed, even though I have the blood of my city, deep down in my heart I still want a quiet, peaceful, and quiet village atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                The views of the mountains, the beauty of the waters flowing with the glow of pearls, the whirlwinds of birds, the winds of tongues, and the cleanliness of the environment are some of the gems that are rarely found when settled in the city.
