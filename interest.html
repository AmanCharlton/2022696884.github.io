            <h2>Hobby</h2>

            <p>
                A leisure hobby is a necessity that exists within an individual to spend time alone or with loved ones. As many people have their own uniqueness in filling their spare time, but if viewed from the Islamic perspective, the most beloved way to fill free time is to think, to do circumcision prayers, to ask forgiveness and to pray for reward, and much more.
            </p>

            <p>
                It may be said that this is a hobby of leisure for every Muslim and Muslim out there, including this writer himself. But how unfortunate, because of not so strong faith, I can only do that with only the power of my powers. However, there are other hobbies that I'm interested in, among them:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                    <li>Watching videos on various platform</li>
                    <li>Watching a movie</li>
                    <li>Playing video games</li>
                    <li>Reading</li>
                    <li>Holidays</li>
                    <li>Eating</li>
                    <li>Browse social media</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                These items will be discussed in more detail in the respective sections below. Therefore, I hope this hobby sharing can give a little as much as what this writer loves.

            <h2>Music</h2>

            <p>
                The music industry is one of almost everyone's interests. Music has existed for hundreds of years and evolved over time. So far we can see how many music categories exist and from that also the emergence of singers who become idols of everyone who hears their works on all platforms, digitally or live like <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=3nVSgfa7GVs2v_oH" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: red;">this song</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                No matter the time or the place, music is a companion, whether it's doing work, playing, doing homework, or sitting alone. There are a few core music that I'm interested in and always listen to, among them:

            <h2>Videography</h2>

            <p>
                Besides music, videography is one of my hobbies. When I was a kid, I could spend hours watching cartoons on TV glass. With technology nowadays, I can access all kinds of stories, dramas, videos, or series just by entering the keyword. However, not everything in the world is free because there are some stories that require me to subscribe to certain slow plans to watch the stories. But with the state of the art of technology, there are many digital broadcasting platforms available, and most importantly, they're all free.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below, I list some online or digital platforms that I use to watch my favorite videos:

                <ol>
                    <li style="color: darkblue;">Bilibili</li>

            <h2>Latest Technology</h2>

            <p>
                As a young man, the desire to spend time with fantasies leaves reality in me. Since I was a kid, I've been exposed to video games starting with just playing in a tablet bought at the Wakaf Che Yeh Night Market. Technological advances at the time were not as advanced as they are now, but it was the most exciting time to be able to play the desired video games.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not enough, as you get older, the gajets you use are also getting more sophisticated. As far as experience is concerned, there are many types of models, brands, and jewelry forms that have been used, including Apple products. But in short, the main motive for using these gajets is to play video games solely, but due to the rapid development of technology, there are a number of questions that will arise if you want to have the latest gajet, among them:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price?</li>
                    <li>Brand?</li>
                    <li>Gadjet specification?</li>
                    <li>Gadjet's advantages?</li>
                    <li>Other things that also important</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                However, with the latest technology, I was able to determine the kinds of idol jets to use. For example:

            <h2>Reading</h2>

            <p>
                According to one statistic, the average Malaysian spending time reading books is still at an unsatisfactory level. This is because the interest in reading does not apply when they are young until they climb to adulthood. There are many factors that cause such problems, including themselves, their parents, financial constraints, and more. In order to prevent this from prolonging, the government has launched an initiative of reading-enhancing program, the "10 Minutes Read Together Program" on April 23 every year. The aim of this program is nothing else, not to nurture the spirit of reading in the Malaysian people's community so that the interest in reading books even for 10 minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Returning back to my childhood, I'm, honestly, not very interested in reading any kind of writing. But the newspapers are something I've always been interested in reading because the papers at the time had a mind-challenging game, so I was tempted to read them while finishing the game. If you want to compare the past with the present, the content of the newspapers no longer attracts my attention to read it, but not to not read it directly, just to spend time.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to reading newspapers, reading comics especially digital comics is also a hobby that is done almost all the time. The existence of a comic book reading platform has been a little as boosting my interest in spending time reading. There's no number of comic book readings because there's a lot of titles and story paths that draw attention to reading them. There are two reading platforms that I always use, namely:

            <h2>Holiday</h2>

            <p>
                Holidays are a must in my family at least once a year to strengthen family ties. In my memory, I can say that almost all the states on the peninsula have been visited for the last 20 years of my life on the face of God. The longest and longest journey I've ever made is to Johor Bharu, which lasts more than 12 hours, subhanAllah, like the jammed on the day of Aidilfitri months ago. To find out more, I'm going to list some places that are usually a vacation destination choice:

            <ul>
                <li>Terengganu: Fishing fields in Besut, Crystal Mosque in Kuala Terengganu & beaches around the state</li>
                <li>Pahang: Cameron Highland, Temerloh & Kuantan</li>
                <li>Perak: Zoo Taiping, Kuala Sepitang & Tanjung Rambutan</li>

            <p>
                In 60 percent of my free time spend playing video games. It used to be about 90% of the time spent playing, but now with little motivation, less and less playing is more focused on completing a very time-consuming course assignment that not only wastes money on spending, but also dries the idea of generating something like the individual assignments IML256 and IML254.

                With short time constraints almost every day, the rate of daily social media usage is rising sharply. It's because of decreasing motivation and lazy feelings that surround the body. However, in the digital age, social media has become an important platform for communicating and receiving important information that happens both at home and abroad. Among the social media platforms I use are:

                    <li>Telegram = 3% usage rate</li>
                    <li>Instagram: 2% usage rate</li>
